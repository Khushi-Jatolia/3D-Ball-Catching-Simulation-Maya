📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple 3D ball catching simulation created in Autodesk Maya using Python scripting. The user controls a paddle inside a 3D arena and attempts to catch balls that fall from above. The simulation demonstrates modeling, animation, scripting, UI creation and interaction inside Maya.

📌 Features
3D arena with walls, floor, paddle and ball prototype
Ball spawns at random positions
Smooth falling motion using keyframe animation
Paddle movement using a custom Python UI
Score increases on successful catch
Automatic ball spawning while the game is running
📌 Tools & Technologies
Autodesk Maya 2026
Python (maya.cmds)
Maya Script Editor
📌 How to Run
Open Maya → Script Editor (Python tab)
Import the scripts:
import setup_scene
import spawn_and_controls

setup_scene.build_scene()
spawn_and_controls.show_controls_window()
spawn_and_controls.start_game()
